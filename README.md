# Image destruction using perlin noise and flow field

#### Daniel Shiffman in his perlin noise tutorial showed a way to visualise perlin noise based on flow field of vectors. 

#### In this challenge I tried to create "image destruction" using the perlin noise, which basically takes the loaded image rgba value and use them in the flow field to damage the image that creates a destruction like illusion.

Here are some example of how we can use perlin noise to damage an image. I played around with particle and scaled parameters to get some interesting result.
